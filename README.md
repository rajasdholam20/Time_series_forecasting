Time Series Forecasting Using ARIMA Model
Time series forecasting involves analyzing historical data to predict future values based on identified patterns, trends, and seasonal effects. The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular statistical approach for time series forecasting, particularly for univariate data.

In the provided workflow, the following steps are performed to forecast the future values of stock prices (e.g., Tesla's "Close" prices):

Steps in the Forecasting Process:
Data Collection:

Historical stock data is fetched using the yfinance library for a specified period.
The dataset includes key stock metrics like "Open," "High," "Low," "Close," and "Volume."
ARIMA Model Overview:

The ARIMA model combines three components:

AR (AutoRegressive): A model that uses past values to predict current values.
I (Integrated): Differencing the data to make it stationary.
MA (Moving Average): A model that uses past forecast errors to improve predictions.
The order of ARIMA is specified as (p, d, q):

p: Number of lag observations for the AR term.
d: Degree of differencing to achieve stationarity.
q: Number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
Model Training and Forecasting:

The ARIMA model is fit incrementally using the training dataset.
One-step-ahead forecasts are generated for the test dataset, updating the model with observed values iteratively.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), which quantifies the prediction error.
Future Forecasting:

The trained ARIMA model is used to forecast future stock prices (e.g., next 60 days).
Confidence intervals are also generated to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions.
Visualization:

Observed data, forecasted values, and confidence intervals are plotted to visualize the model's predictions and its reliability.
Applications:
Financial Markets: Predicting stock prices, index values, or trading volumes.
Supply Chain Management: Forecasting demand or inventory levels.
Energy: Estimating future energy consumption or generation.
Healthcare: Forecasting patient visits or disease outbreaks.
Benefits of ARIMA:
Handles time-dependent structures effectively.
Provides interpretable model components.
Flexible for a wide range of time series data.
Limitations:
Requires stationary data (preprocessing may involve differencing).
Performance may degrade with highly volatile or non-linear data.
Sensitive to parameter selection (p, d, q).
This project demonstrates how ARIMA can be effectively used for forecasting stock prices and how confidence intervals can quantify prediction uncertainty. For more accurate and robust predictions, further fine-tuning of parameters or incorporating external factors (e.g., news sentiment) can be considered.
